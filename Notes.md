# General Tasking

* Add random generation of upgrades
    * Implement upgrades page which randomly choose between possible upgrades


* Add end-of-round screen for restarting gamestate
    * This includes adding a 'reset' paradigm -- A good way for this could be potentially a 'setup' gamestate which defaults objects/state

-- TODOs --
* [ ] Add Quit functionality to `MainMenu`
* [ ] Standardize buttons to be `SIZING_FIT` and padding of 8, 8, 15, 15
